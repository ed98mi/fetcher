## Quick Access to Configs

You can directly access the latest configurations through this URL:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ed98mi/fetcher/refs/heads/main/configs/proxy_configs.txt
```
This project features advanced capabilities for proxy configuration management. The retrieved configurations are automatically converted to Sing-box format and stored in a separate JSON file. For each server, its geographical location is identified using the get location method, and the corresponding flag emoji and country name are automatically added to its tag. These features make proxy management and usage significantly more user-friendly and efficient.

### Detailed Report
ðŸ“Š [View Full Interactive Dashboard](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ed98mi/fetcher/blob/main/assets/performance_report.html)

Each source is scored based on four key metrics:
- **Reliability Score (35%)**: Success rate in fetching and updating configurations.
- **Config Quality (25%)**: Ratio of valid configs to total fetched configurations.
- **Config Uniqueness (25%)**: Percentage of unique configs contributed.
- **Response Time (15%)**: Server response time and availability.

The overall score is calculated in real-time and updated hourly. Sources scoring below 30% are automatically disabled.
